- Gather current, accurate information on the five countries you’ll be including in your application. The information must include the following:
  - Country name
  - Population
  - Capital city
  - Official language(s)
  - Image of flag
- In IntelliJ IDEA, create a Gradle project. Add all required Spring dependencies, and create the directory and package structure of the application. Save all static assets into the proper directory.
- Write the application code, including a data repository and controller.
- Create the index view, which will serve as the homepage of the application. This view must contain the following:
  - A list of the countries you’ve chosen
  - A small thumbnail image of each country’s flag next to its name
  - A clickable link to each country’s detail page (could be the country name and/or flag image)
- Create the detail view. This view must contain all required pieces of information for each country, presented in an easily-readable fashion.
